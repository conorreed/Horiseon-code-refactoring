# <Horiseon Code Refactor>

## Description

I was given code to refactor with the goal of replacing div elements with semantic HTML elements like header, nav, article, and aside. I added descriptive alt tags to images. I also updated the CSS to reflect the changes made to the HTML document. I also employed DRY standards and cleaned up elements of HTML and CSS to not have so many repeating elements. I also made sure to make comments  This process helped me learn about semantic HTML elements because I had to inspect where the elements were on the actual webpage and then apply the appropriate semantic element.

## Credits

Thanks to the bootcamp instructors for answering my questions relating to the turn in criteria.
Also thanks to classmates that are helpful during breakout rooms.
Finally, my dad who is a software developer helped me when I was identifying what semantic HTML elements applied to the code. Big thanks to him.
